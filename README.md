# Robocup
Explore my projects developed for the RoboCup competition. This repository includes examples of my work in AI, natural language processing (Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text), and computer vision (image analysis). You will find implementations that demonstrate my skills in these key areas of robotics and artificial intelligence.
